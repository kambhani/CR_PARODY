            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Bandit has above average use rates and the reason should be obvious: the card is too powerful. Firstly, 
                the core mechanic of the card — invincibility while dashing — is broken. It stops literally anything 
                thrown at it. As an example, a lone Bandit can counter a Sparky by abusing its dash mechanic. The dashing 
                also allows it to pass unharmed through spells like The Log and even allows it to cross the river. Spaced 
                out units will be crushed by the card, as it will simply dash from troop to troop. This should not be a 
                problem, except for the card's insane 160 DPS, greater than that of a Knight or Valkyrie. Finally, the 
                decent health of the card makes killing it a rather annoying task. Some nerfs which should keep the card 
                in line with other troops include: removing the ability for Bandit to dash across the river, a DPS and HP 
                reduction by 3%, increasing minimum dash distance to 4 tiles, and letting the card be damaged by spells 
                while dashing. These changes will make the card less oppressive.
            </p>
            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Bandit, for a legendary card, feels rather outclassed. Knight for example, costs the same, but has way more 
                HP. Stronger DPS is easily achieved with swarms like Skeleton Army and Goblin Gang. The card is also not 
                very versatile, unlike the previously mentioned cards. In fact, the card is mostly seen in Bridge Spam and 
                3M decks. Finally, this card is so easily countered — literally any tank or swarm will take it out. Obviously, 
                this card needs a buff to make it stronger. The best one would be to make the dash deal splash damage, similar 
                to the Dark Prince's. This will make countering the card harder and create new interactions that are such to 
                enhance the metagame.
