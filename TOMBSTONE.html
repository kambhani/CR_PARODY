            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Tombstone is an overpowered card that needs a nerf. For starters, it spawns just as many skeletons as Skeleton Army 
                but is more resistent to splash. This makes countering the card harder as a light spell is not enough to take out 
                the card. Tombstone is also very effective at taking out single target units like PEKKA and Prince. Furthermore, it 
                is tied for being the cheapest building in the game, meaning that the card is very versatile. It is also the cheapest 
                spawner in the game. The card becomes especially frightening when used against a building targetter. The spawned 
                skeletons will stack up and DPS down the opposing troop rather quickly. The skeletons then become scary on the 
                counterpush. The best way to use Tombstone, however, is as ground control. This is why it is often seen in Lava Hound 
                decks as they traditionally lack this. In these decks, the card is an absolute nightmare, capable of getting amazing 
                elixir trades. Overall, the card is simply a little too oppressive in its current state. The best way to nerf it would 
                be to increase the spawn time, thereby lowering the total number of skeletons spawned.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Tombstone is an extremely underpowered card, being the only spawner that can be completely ignored. It is only seen in 
                Lava Hound decks as a cheap ground control unit. In decks with several ground cards, Tombstone has no role. Making a 
                card (Tombstone) dependent on another (Lava Hound) means that the dependent card needs a buff. Tombstone has a 
                below-average use rate, and while there are cards with lower use rates, that is simply the result of the prevalance of 
                Lava Hound decks in the current meta. Tombstone deserves better. A good buff to give it would be to spawn two skeletons 
                with each wave. While the card would still be ignorable on defense, on offense, the card poses a major threat. This should 
                make the card more effective in other decks (like Golem) because of the cheap defensive value it provides.
