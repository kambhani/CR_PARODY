            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Princess is way too broken for the game. The concept of a troop that could outrange a tower is problematic. 
                However, this issue can be resolved by making the card very weak to balance the unique property. However, 
                Princess is not very weak; she is in fact a strong card that sees use in a myriad of decks. An analysis of what 
                makes the card broken must first start with her range of nine tiles. This is very large and is in fact 
                unnecessary, seeing that the Princess Towers only have a range of 7.5 tiles. The extra range the Princess 
                possesses lets it get insane value on defense. It also makes bridge spamming the card a viable chip damage 
                option as that is nearly unreactable. Another issue with the card is its HP. The card was supposed to be fragile, 
                but it has a little too much HP. For example, it survives an Earthquake, giving many decks with the card a bad 
                matchup against Princess. The card also survives a round of shots by the Skeletons. This means that if the Princess 
                user has a spell ready, they can bridge spam the card, get chip damage on the tower, and reactively spell away the 
                Skeletons. Finally, there is the issue of splash damage. The splash radius is quite wide, meaning that the card 
                can make short work of swarms despite her hit speed. These factors make her quite annoying, especially when 
                used in her primary archetype, Log Bait. She synergizes extremely well with Inferno Tower, taking out various 
                distracting troops and allowing the building to target the tank. She is excellent spell bait and cannot be ignored. 
                Overall, these features demand a nerf for the card. To effectively nerf the card, the following changes must be 
                implemented: a range reduction by one tile, an HP nerf by 10%, and a slight splash radius nerf. These changes will 
                stop her from ruining the meta.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Princess is too weak in its current form. It is only viable in Log Bait decks, but even then, she struggles to get 
                significant value. The Log and Barbarian Barrel will counter the card for a positive elixir trade. If one does not 
                use these cards, then Arrows and Miner will counter the card for an even elixir trade. Nearly all decks run at least 
                one of these Princess sniping cards. This makes it hard on Princess users. Additionally, the card shoots so slowly. 
                It seems that the card is not effective at rapid clearing because of this. This makes her outclassed by other cards 
                like Dart Goblin and Bats. Her DPS is rather sad and could use a slight buff. The most prominent competitor to the 
                card is Firecracker. She has replaced the Princess in various Hog Rider decks. Buffs to the Princess should help 
                remedy this issue. Some buffs (which she deserves) include a hitspeed reduction and an HP buff. These modifications 
                should make her useful in non-bait decks.
