            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Guards are simply an overpowered card that cannot continue to exist in its current form. For starters, 
                its very status as a spell-resistent swarm is troubling. These cards are difficult to balance which is 
                why there is only one such card in the game. Using Guards against nearly any non-splash ground unit is 
                good. The card can completely counter a Prince and can stall a PEKKA for a significant length of time. 
                Another annoying aspect of the card is the range each Guard possesses. In fact, the card can attack a 
                distracted Valkyrie without taking any damage. Furthermore, the shield health enables it to survive a 
                Zap or Snowball, making the cards slightly too spell resistent. Overall, this card could use nerfs to 
                bring it more in line with the other swarms. Possible nerfs include a shield HP reduction to 150 (making 
                it zappable), a range reduction to Melee: Medium, and a DPS reduction of 2%. These changes should offset 
                the immense power this card gets by being spell resistent.
            </p>
            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Guards are quite weak in the current meta and need buffs to make them viable. The main reason for this is that 
                the card is outclassed by other similar cards. For example, Skeleton Army and Goblin Gang do more DPS and have 
                more units for swarming. Minions and Minion Horde are aerial troops and that comes with its own suite of benefits. 
                Even the one advantage Guards have — spell resistence — is mitigated by the fact that there are spells that can 
                take them out. In particular, Arrows can take out the card for an even elixir trade, rendering the card nearly 
                useless. These issues make it so that the card does not feel very epic. Some buffs to remove this feeling (and solve 
                the host of problems mentioned about the card) include a shield HP buff to 203 (making the card survive Arrows) and 
                a DPS increase of 5%. These modifications should make the card feel usable.
