            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                The Log currently enjoys one of the highest use rates in the game, and for good reason: 
                in its current iteration, the card is simply too powerful. It one weakness of being unable 
                to attack air is offest by the numerous advantages it enjoys. For example, the insane range 
                of this card enables it to damage an entire push if placed just right. It can also take out 
                cards at the bridge and get 84 chip damage on the opposing crown tower at tournament 
                standard. Cycling this card is an actual option, and the card is so crucial to many decks that 
                there is an entire subset of decks (Log Bait) dedicated to punishing you for not having the card. 
                The amazing versatility of this card is why it is found in nearly all types of decks, from cycle 
                (2.6 Hog and 2.8 Miner) to siege (2.9 X-Bow and 3.5 Ice Bow) to bait (3.3 Classic Log Bait and 3.8 
                Prince Log Bait). Overall, this card needs a nerf, the most necessary of which is a damage reduction. 
                This will stop the card from giving too much value. Another nerf would be to reduce the range by one 
                tile. This will still let the card get chip damage, but then The Log must be placed right at the bridge. 
                The dominance of The Log is annoying, and hopeful these changes will combat that.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Despite having many things going it, there are some things that could be improved about The Log. The most 
                prominent one is the fact that the card cannot attack air units at all. Against cards like Bats or Minions 
                or against Lava Hound decks in general, the card loses way too much value. Also, the card travels way too 
                slowly on the ground, meaning that troops that you are logging could potentially still get hits. There is not 
                too much that the card needs, but possible buffs to make it better include giving it reduced aerial damage 
                (just enough to kill bats) and making it move faster (to better counter tricky Goblin Barrels). These changes 
                will make the card more versatile and easier to use, thus improving use rates.
