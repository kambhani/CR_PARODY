            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Goblin Barrel is too powerful for the cost of three elixir. Left untouched, the card can deal more 
                tower damage than even a Rocket. Throwing tricky barrels also makes it harder for the opponent to 
                know where the card is being thrown, increasing the difficulty in countering the card. It is used 
                predominantly in bait decks as the punishment for the opponent using their small spell. Additionally, 
                unlike many other win conditions, this card actually does quite well on defense, though it should only 
                be used in a pinch. Overall, the card is basically Goblins with whole-field deployability for one more 
                elixir. It is also one of the cheapest win-conditions in the game. This card needs a nerf to make it more 
                fair. The best nerf that would not affect Goblins would be to increase the deploy time of the Goblins from 
                the barrel. Making the card less oppressive is the only way to make bait, an annoying archetype, less 
                prevalent in the metagame.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Goblin Barrel is an underpowered card, simply because of its lack of versatility. The card gets completely 
                countered by small spells (usually for a positive elixir trade), meaning that the card is only viable in bait 
                decks. Even then, the card is useless in many matchups. For example, when playing Classic Log Bait, the card 
                cannot be used against 2.6 Hog or 2.9 X-Bow, simply because those decks will always have The Log in cycle for the 
                card. Defensive use is basically unheard of because of the long deploy time. Tricky barrels are worthless because a 
                skilled player will always be able to counter it. Overall, this card needs buffs to make it viable in other decks. 
                The best buffs that would not affect Goblins would be a Goblin deploy time decrease and a travel time decrease. These 
                changes should make the card useful in other decks as a secondary win condition.
