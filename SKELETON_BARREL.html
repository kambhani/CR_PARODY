            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                For just three elixir, Skeleton Barrel has proven to be a far too potent card. Its quick travel speed, 
                it death damage, and its skeleton spawn combine to form a monster that is nearly impossible to defeat. 
                A careful analysis of its overpowered status must focus on each of these aspects. The first, travel 
                speed, makes countering the card extremely difficult. Quick reaction is key to even stand a chance. 
                Additionally, improper building placement is possible due to the card being airborne. This can easily 
                cost the game. Slow cards don't stand a chance. The death damage on the card is also busted, being strong 
                enough to even kill Spear Goblins. This makes countering the card nearly impossible, as even if the Skeletons 
                are spelled away for a +1 trade, the opponent has still taken over 100 damage onto their tower, clearly the 
                losing end of the bargain. The death damage also makes preplacing swarms not an option for countering. Finally, 
                the spawned skeleton count can decimake towers. The skeletons also perform well on defense â€” use an opposing 
                air-targetting troop to destroy the barrel and then use the skeletons to wipe out a push. Overall, the card needs 
                a nerf. Arguably the most broken aspect of the card is its death damage so that must be targetted first. A death 
                damage reduction should stop Spear Goblins from dying while reducing tower damage. Another option would be to slow 
                movement speed. This gives more reaction time for the player and more time for the crown tower to destroy the barrel. 
                Either change should make the card less obnoxious.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Skeleton Barrel is in a pretty weak spot. It is so easy to counter and rarely gets value. For starters, the card is 
                only used in swarmy decks like Golem clone, Double Barrel Bait, and Mega Knight Bait. Being viable in only one 
                archetype signals a lack of versatility that needs to be addressed. It is so easily countered by spells for a positive 
                elixir trade. Bats, Minions, Spear Goblins, and other air targetting troops dispose of the card quite easily. There is 
                also a way to counter all the skeletons (but not death damage) by using a Magic Archer, Princess, Firecracker, or Ice 
                Spirit but it requires impeccable placement and timing. Obviously, tech that works against the card is quite detrimental 
                and it another reason why it is not good. Finally, unlike Goblin Barrel, there is no guarantee that the card will ever 
                reach the tower. This is why many Log Bait decks choose Goblin Barrel over this card. In the end, it is clear as day that 
                unless this card is given some love, it will fade away into obscurity. One needed change is for skeleton immunity during 
                their spawn time as this will prevent the tech mentioned earlier. Another useful, but not necessary change, would be a speed 
                buff (coupled with an HP nerf). Finally, a death damage increase couldn't hurt.
