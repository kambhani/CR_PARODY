            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Miner is the most used win condition in the game. It is one of the most broken cards in the game, if 
                not the most broken. The OP nature of the card stems from its unique status as an instant tank. For just 
                three elixir, the card can turn any defense into a solid counterpush that requires immediate addressing. 
                The card's HP makes its role that much better, and by extension, that much harder to deal with. Pushes with 
                the card can destroy a tower for as little as five elixir (Miner + Bats). Another annoying aspect about the 
                card is that it can do hundreds of chip damage when left alone. This seems unfair â€” the Miner gets to be an 
                instant tank AND a chip damage card? A further aspect of the card which is rather annoying is its range. This 
                makes the card (when locked onto the crown tower) very difficult, if not impossible, to retarget by surrounding 
                it with swarms. Miner is also one of the few win conditions that can acutally be useful on defense. Also, the 
                Miner can actually tank both princess towers, allowing for some serious split-lane pressure. This card's versatility 
                enables it to be in nearly any deck. From Mega Knight Bait to Lava Miner to Miner cycle to Miner Balloon, this card 
                is seen everywhere. Overall, this card could use some drastic nerfs to make it more fair. These include: a crown tower 
                damage multiplier of 0.1 instead of the current 0.35 (for less chip damage), an HP reduction by 5% (for less tanking), 
                and a range reduction to Melee: Short (for easier retargetting). These changes should make the card less oppressive to 
                face.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Miner is a decent card but it lacks some stats that could really make the card great. To start off, the card has 
                a rather unfortunate amount of hitpoints, especially when compared to the Knight. It also has less DPS than this card 
                and even less crown tower damage to boot. Its deploy time takes forever which makes it very hard to use on defense. 
                Activating King Tower with this card is also way too easy. Many decks that could use this card opt for other cards 
                instead because of its flaws. For example the KT activation potential means that nearly no Graveyard deck runs the card. 
                Its overall paltry defensive capability explains why decks like Classic Log Bait opt for Knight instead. Overall, this 
                card could use buffs to make it better. Such buffs could include an HP buff, a faster deploy time, and a greater mass (to 
                make KT activations harder). These changes should help the card.
