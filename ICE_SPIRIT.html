            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Ice Spirit has been around for a long time, and in my opinion, it feels quite overused. Acting as 
                basically a mini-freeze for one-fourth the normal cost, its versatility is astounding. It 
                retargets troops, can be used as a cycle card, can be used as chip damage, and distracts/freezes 
                enemy troops. For one elixir, that is too much. Nerfs which can bring it in line with other troops 
                include an HP nerf, a reduction in freeze time (to about 0.1s), and complete removal of its retarget 
                ability. These changes will make the card more fair.
            </p>
            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Honestly, ice spirit has been very underwhelming, seeing as it has so much potential. It suffers 
                the injustice of being the least-used one elixir card in the game. This is unacceptable. Its splash
                radius is also pitiful, being next to useless in dealing with skeleton army and other mass swarms.  
                The card's freeze duration is pathetic, and honestly, it is next to useless. To bring Ice Spirit 
                back into the metagame, I propose the following buffs: increase splash radius by 50%, increase HP by
                10%, and double the freeze duration. These changes may just make the card viable again.
