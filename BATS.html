            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Bats are incredibly overpowered, enjoying one of the highest use rates in the game. 
                The main reason for this is its amazing versatility. For 2 elixir, the user is granted 
                a flying swarm that, when left untouched, can dish out over 300 damage per second. The 
                cheap cost enables the card to be used as a cycle card. When tanked for (most infamously 
                the Miner), this card can shred a tower's HP. Bats, in fact, have one of the highest use 
                rates in the entire game! Overall, the DPS, cycle abilities, and synergies render this 
                card absolutely broken. Possible nerfs to bring the card into line would be to reduce 
                the number of bats to 3 and to reduce movement speed. These changes will make the meta 
                more diverse.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Bats really need a buff, seeing how there are several things wrong with the card. For one, 
                this card dies to just about anything; the bats are VERY fragile. Also, when placed at the 
                bridge, the card can only deal 67 damage to the tower at tournament standard. In contrast, 
                cards like Wall Breakers and Spear Goblins deal far more damage when bridge-spammed. Finally, 
                the card's hitspeed of 1.1 seconds is interesting when compared with the 1 second hit speed of 
                skeletons. I propose the following buffs to the card: a health increase by 10%, the addition of 
                a sixth bat, and a hit speed reduction to 1 second (to better standardize attack speed and give 
                Bats a boost in the process).
