            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Baby Dragon is an incredibly oppressive and versatile card that needs a nerf. First of all, it has a lot 
                of health. While this would usually not be bad, the fact that the card flies makes taking it out very 
                difficult. In fact, the card survives a Lightning. Furthermore, the card deals splash damage, making swarms 
                not an option for taking the card out. Its DPS is enough to one-shot Skeletons, Bats, and Spear Goblins. Also, 
                Baby Dragon can be used both as a tank (for Graveyard in Splashyard decks) and as a support unit (for Golem in 
                Golem beatdown decks). This versatility explains its above average use rates. Overall, Baby Dragon needs a nerf. 
                The most needed nerf is a health decrease so that the card dies to Lightning. A DPS nerf wouldn't hurt either.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
               Baby Dragon is a weak card in the current meta and the reason is clear â€” currently, the card is overshadowed by 
               the Skeleton Dragons. For the same cost, that card flies, deals more DPS, and can be split. Baby Dragon deals hardly 
               any DPS and it's only one troop. In terms of grounded splashers, there are several more options. Ice Wizard is cheaper 
               and slows down troops, but at the severe cost of DPS. Hunter is a viable tank-killer, but is more fragile and has a 
               weak ranged attack. Magic Archer is very fragile but has arrows that pierce through enemies. Executioner, for just 
               one more elixir, has more health and range. The availability of other options explains why Baby Dragon is so weak. 
               A buff to make it stronger would a DPS increase so that the card could one-shot Goblins. A range increase would also be 
               nice.
