            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Battle Healer is a broken card that needs nerfs. As a staple in the no-skill Elixir Golem deck, it has 
                proven to the CR world just how annoying it is. One of the problems with the card is that it has so many 
                hitpoints, enough to survive a Rocket. This is inherently unfair, seeing as other cards like Executioner 
                and Sparky (which cost more elixir) die to it. Spelling out the card is a horrible elixir trade, meaning 
                that the only way to take out the card is through troops. With a tank in front of the card, however, that 
                proves very challenging as the heal mechanic of the card comes into play (another broken aspect of the card). 
                Whenever the card attacks an opposing troop, it heals everything around it (including itself). Destroying the 
                card then becomes near impossible. Finally, there is the issue of the card's passive healing. This basically 
                mitigates any spell value on the card. Overall, Battle Healer is a no-skill overpowered card that needs serious 
                nerfs. The best nerfs would be to reduce HP so it dies to Rocket, prevent the card from active healing itself, 
                and reduce (if not remove) passive healing. These changes should stop Battle Healer from being oppressive.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
               Battle Healer is a weak card that needs a buff. The only card that it is viable with is Elixir Golem. This is an 
               inherent burden on the card which prevents it from being versatile. Consequently, its use rates are very low. 
               Battle Healer is basically a worse Knight / Valkyrie. Its DPS is also pathetic. Though a low DPS helps its offensive 
               capabilites, it severely hampers its defensive capabilities. This hurts the versatility of the card. The healing the 
               card produces is also weak and could use a buff. Finally, the HP of the card makes it die very quickly on defense. 
               Overall, the card is weak and needs buffs. Buffs it needs include an HP buff, a healing buff, a DPS buff, and a Heal 
               Spirit spawn upon death. These changes should make Battle Healer vesatile enough to fit in decks besides Elixir Golem 
               ones.
