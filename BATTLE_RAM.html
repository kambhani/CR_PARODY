            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                For just four elixir, Battle Ram has proven to be one of the most broken cards in the game. Its kiting 
                ability makes it very powerful, able to both distract troops and create a threat in the opposite lane 
                (something that the Ice Golem cannot do). It can be used for instant pressure and punishing. If the card 
                should reach the tower, the damage dealt will be extreme. The Battle Ram can also be used head-on into a 
                push for its Barbarian spawn. The utility of the card explains why it is found in all sorts of decks, from 
                3M to PEKKA Bridgespam. Overall, this card needs some serious nerfs. The most needed nerf would be the 
                removal of its charging mechanic. This would make the card more fair to fight against.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
               Battle Ram is an underpowered card that seriously needs some buffs. It is one of the only building targeters 
               that cannot be used as a solo win condition. It is also very expensive at four elixir. Most decks would be 
               better off using Hog Rider or Valkyrie in its place. Battle Ram is really only seen in 3M or PEKKA Bridgespam 
               decks, but even then, the card is not vital. Many of these decks can replace Battle Ram for another card and do 
               just fine. Battle Ram offers little value to the metagame. To remedy this, buffs are in order. One buff that would 
               be especially useful would be to add a third Barbarian to it. This would increase both the defensive and offensive 
               prowress of the card, bringing it in line with other cards.
