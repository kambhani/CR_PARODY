            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Fisherman is simply too powerful. It is an oppressive force that must be reckoned with. Basically a 
                walking Tornado, the card can easily decimate a push by separating the tank from the support troops. 
                Troops that are hooked in even suffer a slowdown which is unfair. The seven tile hook range of the 
                card is crazy. It can even pull troops into the other lane. The DPS of the card just adds to the card 
                immense versatility, as does the decent HP. Overall, this card needs a nerf to make it more balanced. 
                One such nerf would be an HP and DPS reduction. Another nerf would be a reduction/removal of the slowdown 
                experienced by hooked troops. Either change would make the card easier to face.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Fisherman is one of the least used cards in the game. It suffers from the status of not feeling "legendary", 
                despite having that rarity. Though it can hook troops, it is limited to only ground and only one troop at a 
                time. For this reason, nearly every deck that desires opposing troop relocation opts for Tornado. Additionally, 
                the hook charge time on the card is simply too much. It takes forever for the card to actually hit something. 
                There is always the possibility that the Fisherman draws in an unwanted card towards it. For example, if it were 
                next to the princess tower, then drawing in a Giant Skeleton means that you can say bye-bye to that tower. The HP 
                and DPS are pretty pathetic as well, especially for a legendary card. In sum, this card needs DRASTIC buffs to make 
                it viable. These include a hook charge reduction time, a DPS buff, an HP buff, and potentially a hook range increase. 
                These changes will bring Fisherman back from the depths of uselessness, a fate that a legendary card should not suffer.
