            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Ice Wizard is extremely overpowered. For just three elixir, the user is granted a splash unit that 
                can attack air. This by itself should sent at least a warning sign. What really makes this card 
                broken, however, is its slowdown mechanic. Many troops become easy pickings for the crown tower when 
                the speed is reduced. The card truly shines when it is paired with Tornado. This Ice Wizard + Tornado 
                combo requires little skill and can decimate entire pushes. For this reason, Ice Bow has become one of 
                the most hated decks in the community. Ice Wizard is also a primarily defensive card and as the developers 
                themselves have noted, defensive gameplay is not encouraged. On offense, cards like Snowball and Freeze do a 
                better job of slowing enemy troops. Overall, the card needs serious nerfs (or even possibly a rework) to prevent 
                it from being both too defensive and too oppressive. The best nerf to do this would be to reduce the slowdown 
                percent from 35% to 25%. A range nerf to 5 tiles wouldn't hurt either.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Ice Wizard is a very weak card in the current meta. It needs buffs to make it more viable. Though the card has decent 
                use rates, the reason for this is that the card is carried by Tornado. Without Tornado, Ice Wizard would be next to 
                useless. It does not, however, work the other way around â€” a deck with Tornado can function without Ice Wizard. This 
                is evident in Tornado's far greater use rates than Ice Wizard. One weak area of this card is its paltry DPS, doing next 
                to no damage. This is even more clear with a tank. Countering the card is so easy, especially when at the bridge alone. 
                With the help of the crown tower, Ice Wizard can be countered with both Skeletons and Ice Spirit for a positive elixir 
                trade. In sum, this card needs buffs to make it better. Such buffs include a faster attack speed (which should also 
                boost DPS) and a range increase to 6 tiles. These changes should make the card usable without Tornado.
