            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                For just three elixir, the user is entitled to one of the highest DPS cards in the game. 1000 DPS is insane for 
                such a low cost. Even actual tank killers like Mini Pekka deal less than half of that. The swarm is composed of 
                fifteen skeletons. The sheer numbers enables the card to counter splash units like Wizard, Executioner, and even 
                Bomber simply by surrounding them. The size of the swarm allows the card to easily counter a Goblin Barrel. The 
                card also works effectively as an aerial distractor. For a positive elixir trade, Skeleton Army can distract the 
                Flying Machine and Inferno Tower while the crown tower finishes them off. Additionally, a Skeleton Army at the 
                bridge is an easy 1000 damage if left ignored. Since the card is also good spell bait, it is used quite often in 
                decks where this matters. Examples would include Log Bait (replacing Ice Spirit, making the deck more swarmy),
                Giant Sparky (where baiting out the Zap lets the Sparky get a connection), and Golem Clone (where sheer numbers 
                help overwhelm the opponent). Skeleton Army is able to get very good elixir trades, especially against tanks like 
                Goblin Giant and PEKKA. Overall, this card could use a nerf, and the best one would be to reduce skeleton count to 
                12. This would lower DPS significantly, thereby making the card more balanced.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Skeleton Army is too weak in its current form, the reason being that it is too easy to spell out. Many decks that run 
                the card have no other answer to single-targetting units, meaning that once the card is gone, the user takes massive 
                crown tower damage. Goblin Gang, one of its competitors, is more spell resistant and can attack aerial units, making up 
                for its lower DPS. This is why many players see Goblin Gang as the better card â€” it is simply more versatile. Bats, 
                Skeletons, Goblins, and Spear Goblins are other cheap swarms that compete with Skeleton Army. Compared with all of these 
                cards, Skeleton Army is more expensive, thereby making it less versatile. The card should get a buff to make it better. 
                One option for this would be to reduce the cost to 2 elixir but only summon 8 skeletons. This would make the card more 
                useful while being less risky. Another option would be to add spell immunity to the card for the first second of its use. 
                This would help the card get rid of tanks without as much risk. Finally, the easiest buff option would be to increase the 
                number of skeletons to 16 or 17. A DPS increase is always a welcome change. Whichever change is chosen, it is sure to make 
                Skeleton Army a better part of the meta.
