            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Royal Delivery is too powerful for three elixir. For one, its radius, wider than that of a Fireball, 
                makes it easy for the card to hit incoming troops. It can also snipe a Princess at the bridge. The card 
                can defeat many support troops for a positive elixir trade, including Musketeer, Wizard, and Magic Archer. 
                Royal Delivery is especially powerful when defending a push as placing it over the support units ensures an 
                easy defense. Also, the card does more damage than Arrows and Earthquake for the same cost. Great value is 
                a hallmark of broken cards and this one has it in spades. Its air attacking abilities only serve to make the 
                card even more broken than it already is. Finally, there is the giant issue of the spawned Royal Recruit.
                Its stats enable it to wreck pushes further, as well as absorb serious blows (like a Sparky hit, Prince / DP 
                charge, etc.), courtesy of its shield. Overall, the card could use a nerf to bring it more in line with the 
                other small spells. One way to do this is to nerf damage output. If that proves insufficient, reduced aerial 
                damage could also be explored as a possibility.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Royal Delivery is really weak and needs buffs. One of the biggest problems with it is its horrible deploy time. 
                While some may say that the three second deploy times introduces skill, that may not be the best thing. After all, 
                at top ladder, every player has mastered the timing of the card. Whether the deploy time is one, two, or three 
                seconds, top players will be able to use the card effectively. They do not suffer from a horrible deploy time. It 
                is the majority of the playerbase stuck in mid-ladder that suffers. A quicker deploy time should not affect top 
                ladder significantly but should work wonders at the 5k range. A damage buff could also be helpful, seeing as the 
                defensive-only spell lacks any offenisve value. If these changes were to be introduced, then the card would be viable 
                once more.
