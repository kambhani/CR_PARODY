            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                The Bomber is overpowered in the current meta for a variety of reasons. The first (and 
                arguably the largest) reason is that the card is too tanky, being able to survive even 
                arrows. Spelling out this card alone is not possible unless you are willing to accept a 
                negative elixir trade. Such high HP makes no sense when compared to the card's tiny 
                frame. Additionally, the card has a large splash radius, making it able to counter every 
                ground swarn in the game. Unlike other splashers (like Ice Wizard), surrounding the card 
                with Skeletons is nearly useless because one throw of the bomb deals with multiple skeletons. 
                The DPS is also insane, considering that it is greater than the Knight's as well as having range 
                and splashing abilities. In sum, the card could use nerfs to make it more balanced. The best nerf 
                would be to make it die to Arrows by reducing HP. Other nerfs that could be employed if necessary 
                include a range nerf, a splash radius nerf, and/or a DPS nerf. These changes will make the card 
                more fair to play against.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Bomber is one the least used cards in the game because it is outclassed. There are substitutes that 
                do the job it is supposed to do but do it better. Firecracker, for example, deals splash damage for 
                the same cost, but can take out aerial troops as well. Ice Wizard can slow troops down and has more 
                health (though it does suffer from lower DPS). Targetting only grounded troops is obviously a versatility 
                issue for the card. Wizard, for two more elixir, does everything better than the Bomber. The card also travels 
                slowly and dies to Fireball, a common spell seen in many decks like 2.6 Hog, 2.9 X-Bow, and various Lava Hound 
                decks. Overall, the card needs a buff in one form or another. Some potential buffs include: faster movement speed, 
                aerial targetting capabilities, and/or a health increase. These change should hopefully increase the card's abysmal 
                use rates.
