            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Wall Breakers offer far too much value for the 2 elixir cost it possesses. As the 
                cheapest win condition in the game, the card is used to constantly pressure the 
                opponent. Because of this, the card is found chiefly in cycle decks, particularly 
                those that have the Miner. The HP of the card also allows it to be split in the 
                middle for a total commitment of one elixir per lane. Left unattended, this simple 
                action can deal over 300 damage in each lane. Countering split-lane Wall Breakers 
                often involves a negative elixir trade. As if this were not enough, the card can 
                also be used to kite troops like the Bandit, adding defensive value to a primarily 
                offensive tool. Overall, this card needs nerfs to make it more balance. The best one 
                would be to nerf health so split-lane Wall Breakers is not as big of a threat. A 
                damage reduction can also be explored if the HP nerf is not enough.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Wall Breakers need buffs to make them more viable, because in their current state, 
                they simply cannot be used. The main reason for this is that the card possesses 
                virtually no value if the deck does not also contain Miner. This vastly limits the 
                amount of decks the card can be in. Hence, the best way to make Wall Breakers more 
                prominent is to make it more viable without Miner. Some ways to do this include: a 
                HP buff so Miner does not need to tank for Wall Breakers most of the time, a damage 
                buff because the card rarely makes it to the tower (so when it does, the user should 
                be rewarded more), and a splash radius increase (to better damage opposing troops). 
                These changes will make the card more versatile, thus increasing use rates.
