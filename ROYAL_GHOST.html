            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Royal Ghost is simply too powerful. One of the main issues with the card is its invisibility. Leaving the 
                card with a sliver of HP left means a guaranteed 200+ damage on its next target. It spawns invisible, 
                meaning that the card is not vulnerable at the time. This is in sharp contrast with the Tesla, which spawns 
                in an attackable state. If that were not enough, the card also has a decent amount of hitpoints, making it 
                tanky enough to even survive a Lightning. Royal Ghost can also serve as a tank to other cards if it is attacking. 
                Finally, there is the issue of damage, as its moderate damage is exacerbated by its spalsh damage. The card can 
                one-shot log bait cards like Rascal Girls, Princess, and Dart Goblin, as well as small swarms like Skeletons and 
                Spear Goblins. Bridge spamming the card is a viable way to pressure the opponent. Overall, the card deserves a 
                nerf to make it less powerful. The best nerfs to implement would be to spawn visible and reduce the splash radius. 
                These changes should make the card less dominating.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Royal Ghost is an underpowered card, seen only in PEKKA Bridgespam. The reason should be obvious — the card is 
                outclassed by other cards. The invisibility is more of a gimmick than an actually useful ability. Every other 
                aspect of the card is mediocre. Its meager splash is outclassed by Dark Prince and Valkyrie for +1 elixir and 
                its HP is equalled by Miner and outclassed by Knight for the same elixir cost. Additionally, all four of these 
                cards can kite aerial troops, something that the Royal Ghost simply cannot do. Even its bridge spam utility is 
                outshined by other cards like Bandit. This card excels at nothing and thus needs a buff. The best ways to do this 
                are to either buff HP to make it tankier, make its attack deal 360° damage like the Valkyrie, and/or increase DPS. 
                These changes should make the card viable in more decks and bring up it average use rates.
