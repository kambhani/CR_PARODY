            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Cannon, for just 3 elixir, just gives too much value. Being tied for the cheapest building in the 
                game, the card can work wonders. For example, the card can solo counter Hog Rider, a popular win 
                condition often seen on ladder. It can deal with mini-tanks like Knight and Ice Golem quite nicely. 
                Its true powers, however, come when it is used in 2.6 Hog. There, the card can do things like pull a 
                Balloon to the King Tower (double Cannon KT activation). The DPS of the card is also very high, helping 
                immensely in shutting down an entire Golem push. Overall, this card could use slight nerfs to make it 
                more reasonable, especially considering the cheap cost. The best way to do this would be to nerf DPS as 
                this would make dealing with mini-tanks and building-targeters harder with the card. The card, being more 
                balanced, will seem more fair.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Cannon is a weak card, being viable in only one deck: 2.6 Hog. First of all, its pathetic range means that 
                cards like Musketeer and Dart Goblin can outrange, drastically decreasing the power of this card. Additionally, 
                the card dies to Lightning. While this may not seem important, this interaction makes defeating Golem decks using 
                the card very hard. Finally the card cannot target air. While this is to be expected (based on the card's design), 
                it does mean that other aspects of the card should be good. In this case, they are not so buffs are needed. The 
                most needed buff would be a range increase as this would allow the card to starting shooting down troops faster. A 
                health buff could also be useful. These changes will hopefully allow the card to be used in more than one deck.
