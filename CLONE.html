            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Clone is overpowered and needs drastic nerfs to fix its problems. For starters, it basically doubles 
                the DPS of a push. This makes the card very deadly, especially when paired with high DPS cards like 
                Balloon and Skeleton Barrel. In fact, there are entire decks that revolve around abusing the power 
                this card provides. The most prominent example of this is Lava Clone. By using a Clone and hitting 
                multiple air targets like Lava Hound, Baby Dragon, and Bats, the already stressed aerial defense of the 
                opponent are pushed past breaking point. Another deck that has appeared more recently into the meta is a 
                Golem bait deck, comprised of the following: Golem, Night Witch, Flying Machine, Clone, Goblin Gang, Bats, 
                Skeleton Barrel, and Arrows. These toxic decks are made possible by the card known as Clone. A great synergy 
                with Clone is Freeze. Simply Freeze all defense and Clone for an easy tower. Clearly, this card needs a nerf. 
                The best way to do this is to either reduce the radius or set a limit on how many troops can be cloned. But in 
                all honesty, any sort of nerf should put the broken spell in its rightful place.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Clone is an underused card and the reasons for this should be obvious. First and foremost, all of the splash in 
                the meta has made it difficult to use the card effectively. Even decks that lack splash units can use spells to 
                rid the field of cloned troops. The prevalance of splash is just one reason that decks like Lava Clone have fallen 
                into obscurity. It also explains why Clone is one of the least used cards in the game. Another reason that Clone is 
                underpowered is that its radius is too small. Often, separating troops in a push is vital to avoid giving the 
                opponent spell. However, this comes with the cost of not being able to clone the entire push. Finally, since Clone does 
                not do any damage, it often sits unused in a player's hand. Overall, Clone could use buffs to bring it back into the 
                spotlight. Good changes to advance this goal include a radius increase and the addition of damage to the card, similar to 
                Freeze. These changes will help diversify the meta and thereby make it better.
