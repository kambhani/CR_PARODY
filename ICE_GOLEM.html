            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Ice Golem is one of the best cards in the game, due to its immense versatility. For example, the card is 
                notorious for kiting troops into the opposite lane, one of the most annoying things about the game, if it 
                is your troop being kited. It can be used as a mini-tank, letting higher DPS unit whittle opposing troops 
                down. The most prominent examples of this include Ice Golem + Musketeer (for 2.6 Hog) and Ice Golem + 
                Archers (for 2.9 X-Bow). These combination can take down troops as powerful as a Mega Knight. Ice Golem can 
                also be used as a pseudo-spell, as its death damage kills all equivalent-level bats and skeletons. In the end, 
                the value presented by the card is evident in its immense popularity, being among the most used cards in grand 
                challenges. Nerfing this card will lower its dominance in the meta; the best way to do this is to nerf death 
                damage so that skeletons and bats will not die, removing the pseudo-spell utility the card possessed. If 
                further nerfs are needed, a HP reduction is always an option.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Ice Golem is a decent card, no doubt, but it has some issues that should be addressed. For one, its death damage 
                does not kill skeletons and bats at a higher level. While this is not an issue at tournament standard, it 
                becomes an issue in ladder, which partly explains why the use rate there is much lower than the use rate in 
                grand challenges. Additionally, the card's DPS is rather abysmal, being among the lowest in the game. Fixing both 
                these issues could bring up use rates in both ladder and grand challenges, especially the former. Buffs to 
                accomplish this task include a death damage increase of 10% and a DPS increase of 20%. These changes will also 
                make Ice Golem accessible to the casual player.
