            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Minions are a low-risk high-reward card that it overpowered in the current meta. One of the most glaring 
                issues with the card is its HP, high enough to survive a Zap or Snowball. Their flying attribute makes them 
                immune to The Log or Barbarian Barrel. These factors make it so that the only spell that can take it out for 
                an even trade is Arrows. Even then, many players are reluctant to use the card on Minions because decks with 
                the card punish the player for not having Arrows in hand. This makes the card hard to remove. Additionally, the 
                DPS of the card is insane, being over 80% of the DPS of Bats. It can make quick work of mini-tanks like Knight, 
                Valkyrie, etc. The speed of the card is another positive factor as it lets the Minions keep up with fast units. 
                Overall, this card requires nerfs if it is to be kept in the game. The best nerf option that does not affect 
                Minion Horde is a decrease in count to 2 (or even 1). However, if the card were to be decoupled from Minion Horde, 
                different measures, like an HP or DPS reduction, could be employed. A third option is to not decouple the two cards 
                and nerf both of then simultaneously. After all, Minion Horde is just the broken Minions at a better value. In any 
                case, drastic nerfs should make the card more fair.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Minions are an underpowered card that need buffs to make it viable. The main issue with the card is that it is 
                overshadowed by Bats. After all, the only thing Minions have over Bats is their better HP. Even then, the card 
                is extremely easy to defeat â€” any splash unit will do the trick. The card is also worthless when bridge spammed 
                as that can be countered for just one elixir (Skeletons to kite + distract or Ice Spirit to damage + freeze). 
                The card's DPS isn't that impressive either, being inferior to that of the Bats. While it does have more DPS than 
                a Mega Minion, the latter card is much more spell resistent, making it the choice for killing high-HP troops. 
                The main issue with the card is that it is outclassed. The best way to not make it outclassed is to remove one 
                minion and reduce the cost to 2 elixir. The cheaper cost makes it much more potent. If that fails, then a DPS or 
                HP buff could be employed, though this should be done with caution as Minion Horde will be affected as well. If 
                the listed changes were to be implemented, then the card would have more than its below average use rates.
