            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Dart Goblin is too overpowered for its cost of three elixir. For one, its range enables it to 
                out-range many building like Cannon and Inferno Tower. This is unfair. The range of the card also 
                allows it to snipe many buildings placed on the opponent's side of the field. In a push, the card 
                can stay a safe distance behind the tank because of its range, preventing splash units from easily 
                getting rid of it. Dart Goblin is also useful bait and is seen in 2.8 Double Barrel Bait and 3.8 Prince 
                Log Bait. Another annoying thing about the card is its DPS of over 140. This is insane and it allows the 
                card to take out massive pushes when tanked for. The fast attack rate also means that the card can make 
                short work of Graveyard. Finally, the extremely fast speed of this card makes reacting to it is very hard. 
                The card can take off a lot of tower damage when bridge spammed, often because the opponent simply cannot 
                react to it. In sum, Dart Goblin needs a nerf. The most needed one would be a range reduction to six tiles 
                as this would allow the card to be targetted by Inferno Tower. Another crucial nerf that the card needs is a 
                speed nerf as this would allow the opponent to more easily react to the card.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Dart Goblin has below-average use rates and the reason is clear as day â€” in its current form, the card is 
                too weak. Arguably the biggest problem with the card is its fragility. While this is intended, the card could 
                use a little love in this regard. Another issue is range. In several aspects, Magic Archer outclasses this card, 
                most notable in range. The additionally 0.5 tiles Magic Archer gets means that many people who would use Dart 
                Goblin for the range now use Magic Archer instead. Clearly, the card needs buffs in the two areas mentioned 
                earlier. In regards to the first issue, an HP increase to 230 would still make the card loggable while giving it 
                a small buff. The card would still be used in bait decks because of this. In regards to the second issue, a range 
                increase to seven tiles, similar to the Magic Archer, should help gain the card some usage. These changes will help 
                bring an underused card into the spotlight.
