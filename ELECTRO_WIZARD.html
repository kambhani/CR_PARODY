            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Electro Wizard is too powerful for four elixir, able to perform a variety of roles. One role is swarm control, 
                courtesy of his spawn damage. This ability is shared with only one other troop card in the game (Mega Knight), 
                but unlike the other card, Electro Wizard's spawn damage can damage aerial units. This makes the card very good 
                at taking out swarms, despite not actually dealing splash damage. Additionally, Electro Wizard has a multi-target 
                ability, making the card survive far longer than it should. The multi-target could potentially latch on an Inferno 
                Tower/Dragon, destroying the defender in the process. For this reason, decks like Giant Beatdown and PEKKA 
                Bridgespam opt to carry this card. Finally, the HP of this card allows it to survive a Fireball. This is simply far 
                too much value. Overall, if Electro Wizard were to be balanced, the following changes should be implemented: HP 
                reduction by 3%, removal of spawn damage, and/or removal of multi-target ability.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
               Electro Wizard is really an underwhelming card. It doesn't excel at anything and is so easy to take out. Its reset ability 
               is hampered by this very fact. For example, nearly all Sparky decks run Mini Pekka because that card can one-shot the 
               Electro Wizard. It can be countered by something as simple as Skeletons and ignoring the card is not that dangerous. It 
               dies to Poison. Additionally, it happens to be the only wizard that cannot deal splash damage. Besides being an odd 
               inconsistency, this makes the card very bad against swarms on offense. These are the biggest factors holding the card back, 
               and as such, they should be fixed. Fixing these problems requires both an HP increase of 5% and the addition of splash damage 
               to the card. These changes should hopefully bring the card's usage rates up.
