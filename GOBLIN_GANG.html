            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                The game states that Goblin Gang is a value pack, but what it does not realize is that the value 
                the card provides is simply too much. It is a swarm that can take out a vast majority of the troops 
                in the game, even some surprising ones. For example, the card can take out a naked Valkyrie with the 
                help of the crown tower. The card can surround troops like Firecracker, Wizard, etc. to take them out. Unlike 
                Skeleton Army, this card can take out aerial troops like Mega Minion. Another benefit that this card possesses 
                over Skeleton Army is that the swarm is not completely zappable, meaning that this swarn is more resilient. This 
                resilence becomes especially important against decks like PEKKA Bridgespam, which use Zap. Goblin Gang is a very 
                good swarm, as shown by its position as one of the most used swarms in the game, right after Skeletons and Bats. 
                Hence, this card could use nerfs to make it more fair. These include a count reduction (like 2 and 2) and/or a 
                spawn pattern change (have Spear Goblins spawn in front of Goblins). If the above changes were to be implemented, 
                then Goblin Gang would no longer be so oppressive.
            </p>
            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Goblin Gang is quite underwhelming, being only viable in bait decks. Additionally, this card is easily countered 
                by small spells. Killing the card is easily, especially with cards like Valkyrie and Wizard. This has the 
                additional effect of setting up a counterpush, which could be deadly. Using the card on defense is risky if the 
                opponent uses a prediction spell. The card does far less DPS than Skeleton Army, a card which also has the same 
                elixir cost. For this reason, Skeleton Army is used in non-bait decks like Giant Graveyard. The real problem, though, 
                exists with the design of the card. Other cards do its jobs better. For DPS, there is Skeleton Army, as stated earlier. 
                For cheap ground swarm, there are Skeletons and Goblins. For cheap aerial defense, there are Spear Goblins and Firecracker. 
                Being a "value pack" is just a sugercoated way of saying "mediocre at everything". To remedy this situation, the card needs 
                buffs. The best buff would be to revert the card to its earlier state and have three Spear Goblins. This will make it good 
                enough to use more widely in the meta.
