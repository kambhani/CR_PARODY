            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Arrows, for simply 3 elixir, are far too powerful. The most prominent feature of the card is its 
                staggered damage, which allows it to take out troops (like Guards) that no other troop can. Its 
                damage takes out troops like Firecracker, Archers, and Minions. The radius of the card allows the 
                user to be less precise with no drawbacks. For example, identifying tricky Goblin Barrels with 
                Arrows is much simpler â€” just aim at the tower and most barrels are gone. Overall, Arrows offers too 
                much value for the cost. The best way to make Arrows less OP is to reduce the radius by 0.5 tiles. This 
                will make the card more high-skill while still retaining all interactions.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Arrows suffers from problems that make it less useful than other spells. For one, its travel time makes 
                aiming slightly more difficult, especially against Firecracker, one of the hardest cards to hit. The damage 
                is also quite sad, being unable to even kill a Bomber. There is not too much wrong with it, but some buffs are 
                in order. For one, a faster travel time (or even no travel time like Zap or Poison) is in order. A damage buff 
                could also be employed, potentially up to 400 damage (so Bomber dies to the Spell). These changes could make the 
                card more viable.
