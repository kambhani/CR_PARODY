            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Tornado, by design, is an overpowered card. For just three elixir, the user can negate their opponent's skilled troop 
                placement and easily take towers. The card's insane offensive abilities are why the card is seen in Golem and Elixir 
                Golem decks. There, the card is used to suck in all of the defending troops to one spot, where they are easy pickings 
                for the tank's support troops. Tornado also has broken defensive properties, explaining why the card is found in the 
                rather infamous Icebow deck. Additionally, Tornado is often used with Rocket for easy troop damage. The two cards are 
                found in other decks besides Icebow (like 2.9 Morter cycle and Hog ExeNado). Furthermore, the card is used to easily 
                activate the king tower. This is devastating for Goblin Barrel and Graveyard decks. Skillful king tower activations 
                (like using Cannon + Skeletons on Mega Knight or even any troop against the Firecracker) are laid to waste. Tornado 
                makes the game toxic and needs a rework. The way to make Tornado a fair card is as follows: decrease radius to 4.5 
                tiles, reduce pull strength by 5%, and reduce Tornado damage by 50%. These changes should keep the card in check. 
            </p>
            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Tornado is an underpowered card that fails to do anything meaningful. For starters, its synergy with splash troops is 
                nearly nonexistent, seeing as the duration is only one second. King tower activations are not easy, and failure to pull 
                one off means hundreds of lost tower damage. Some KT activations are noted for being hard (like no-hit Hog). Additionally, 
                the card does hardly any damage, meaning that it is nearly useless for chip damage. Troop relocation has become Tornado's 
                main use, but other cards can be used instead. For example, Fisherman is a very good card for this purpose. Obviously, 
                Tornado needs buffs to make it viable. The best buffs to give it would be a duration increase to two seconds. This should 
                increase its synergy with splash damage cards and bring the card back into the meta.
