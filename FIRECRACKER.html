            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Firecracker gives too much value for just three elixir. As a ground & air targetting splasher, its 
                versatility is astounding. It makes short work of swarms and is useful on defense as it can attack the 
                tank and still hit the support troops behind it, similar to a Magic Archer. The range of six tiles, more 
                than that of Archers, is simply unfair. However, arguably the most annoying mechanic this card possesses 
                is the pushback mechanic. Aiming spells at her is extremely difficult if you don't have Arrows. The card 
                also give melee troops a hard time. Cards like Knight, Valkyrie, etc. are forced to walk large distances to 
                even interact with the card. When placed right, this card can even kite melee troops which is just insane. 
                Even troops with projectiles suffer, most notably the Bowler, whose slow attack speed coupled with the 
                Firecracker's pushback results in a nightmare for the former. Overall, this card needs a nerf. The two most 
                vital nerfs are an HP reduction to 216 (to make it loggable), and a pushback reduction of 0.5 tiles. These changes 
                should make the card easier to handle.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                For three elixir, the card is simply quite underwhelming. For one, playing against the card means a free King Tower 
                activation. For some decks, most notably Graveyard, this basically means a lost game. For this reason, Graveyard decks 
                (as well as other decks like Goblin Barrel ones) simply cannot use the card. Furthermore, the card is hard to control 
                due to its pushback effect. Often, though it is deployed in one lane, it will wander off into the other due to the 
                pushback it gets. This is terribly annoying. In sum, there are changes that could be made to address the card's flaw. 
                One such change would be to increase the range to seven tiles. This would stop the card from activating as many King 
                Towers. Another important way to buff the card is to make it so that a naked Firecracker does not activate the King 
                Tower in 2v2. These changes would make the card more viable.
