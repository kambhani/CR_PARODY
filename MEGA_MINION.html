            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                For just three elixir, Mega Minion has proven itself to be a very powerful card that needs nerfs to make 
                it more fair. One of the red flags with the card is the giant boost it gets from being a flying troops. 
                While this by itself is not enough to warrant a nerf, the various other traits Mega Minion possesses push 
                the card to nerf territory. For one, the card is very spell resistent, able to even withstand an entire 
                Poison. This makes the card virtually uncounterable on defense. Besides this tanky behavior, the card also 
                possesses a DPS greater than that of a Knight and nearly as much as a Musketeer. Using the card to take out 
                tanks is very effective. Additionally, Mega Minion has a decent range which only makes the situation worse. 
                The abundance of positive traits this card has explains its above-average use rates as well as its role in 
                several deck archetypes, including Golem beatdown, LavaLoon, and Lava Miner. Clearly, this card needs a nerf. 
                The best nerf to give it would be an HP reduction so that it dies to Poison (but not Fireball), similar to 
                Musketeer and Wizard. A range reduction to Melee: Medium could also be employed.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Mega Minion has found itself restricted to just a few decks and the reason should be clear: the card lacks 
                significant value and versatility. One glaring problem with the card is its pathetic hitspeed. At a disastrous 
                1.6 seconds, it get too easily distracted by troops like Skeletons and Bats. Another glaring flaw with the card 
                is its sad movement speed. It travels as slow a Balloon, which is strange to think about as the latter card has 
                much more HP. Finally, the card's DPS is rather lacking, seeing as it is much lower than that of the Minions. These 
                flaws hold the card back from fitting into more decks. A buff to the card should fix the problem. Among those that 
                could be employed include: a hitspeed decrease (which would also boost DPS), a speed buff to Fast (like Minions), 
                and a range buff to 2 tiles. These changes should improve the card, and by extension, the entire metagame.
