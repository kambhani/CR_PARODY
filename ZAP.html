            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Zap is one the most used cards in the game and for good reason — the card is way too overpowered. 
                For just two elixir, the user gets a spell that can damage troops, reset troops, targets both 
                ground and air, and has no travel time. The combination of all of this is responsible for the 
                use rates. From PEKKA bridge spam to Mega Knight bait to Giant double prince, so many decks use this 
                card. The card can take out troops like Skeletons, Bats, and Spear Goblins. With the help of other 
                cards, Zap can decimate Inferno Tower, explaining the latter's below average use rates. The reset 
                property can also destroy a hard-earned X-Bow lock by retargeting it onto a tank. Overall, the card 
                is busted and needs nerfs. Since reset is a unique characteristic, it should not be touched. However, a 
                damage nerf is in order, more specifically one that will prevent a Zap from killing equal level Spear 
                Goblins. Zap only needs enough damage to kill Skeletons and Spear Goblins. Hence, this nerf would make 
                Zap less oppressive while still being a useful card.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Zap needs buffs to make it more useful since it is outclassed by The Log. Many of the most popular decks 
                (like 2.6 Hog, 2.9 X-Bow, Classic Log Bait, Ice Bow, etc.) use it instead of Zap. Other decks like Splashyard 
                control, many 3M decks, and many Golem decks run Barbarian Barrel instead of Zap. Still other decks like Giant 
                Graveyard and Balloon cycle run Snowball instead of Zap. The point should be clear — Zap is simply outclassed. 
                To make the card more viable, the radius of the spell should be increased from 2.5 to 3. This will allow the card 
                to better compete with The Log and Barbarian Barrel. A damage buff so that Zap kills Goblins is also in order. This 
                will allow Zap to take out Goblin Barrel completely. These changes are sure to make Zap a better card for the game.
