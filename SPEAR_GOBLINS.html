            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Spear Goblins offer too much value for two elixir. For one, they can be used as a cycle 
                card, and can get chip damage on the opposing tower when placed at the bridge. The card is 
                also very good for defense, with the long range able to take out units from afar. In fact, 
                the card can counter cards like Mini Pekka and Knight with the help of the Princess Towers. 
                Furthermore, Spear Goblins also serves as a useful bait tool to rid the opponent of cards like 
                Zap, Giant Snowball, and The Log, and is used in decks like Mega Goblins to that effect. Finally, 
                the card has annoying synergies with other cards like Miner and Knight, seen very well with its 
                use in decks like 2.8 Miner cycle. Overall, Spear Goblins could use a nerf in the form of a count 
                reduction to 2. This would make the card less oppressive.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Spear Goblins need a buff to be viable, because in its current state, it is outshined by other cards. 
                For example, for one more elixir, you can have Firecracker, a ranged attacker that also happens to have 
                splash damage. Another alternative would be Goblin Gang, a three elixir card that is simply much more 
                versatile. Additionally, the card dies to Zap and Snowball, making the card simply not worth the cost. 
                Finally, the attack speed is very slow, meaning that the card cannot get as much value. To remedy the 
                situation, many options are available. For one, a count increase to 4 would be nice and would not 
                affect the other spear goblin-based cards. Another option is a hitpoint buff, so the card will survive Zap, 
                Snowball, and Skeleton Barrel death damage. This would affect the other spear goblin-based cards though, 
                so implementing the change would require some caution. A higher DPS could also be employed if necessary. 
                These changes, if added, will push Spear Goblins out of the Dark Ages.
