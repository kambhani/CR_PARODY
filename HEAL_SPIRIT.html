            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Heal Spirit, first of all, has far too much healing power, able to negate hundreds of damage done to troops. Most 
                notably, when paired with royal hogs, the card has next to no serious counterplay. Though some might say to simply
                log the card away, why should you be forced to do a minus one trade, simply to compete? The one elixir cost also allows
                the card to be used for cycling with no room for punishment. Its good use rates in grand challenges just shows how broken
                this card is. It can also be used for tower chip damage. Overall, this card is way too versatile. Some ways to make this 
                card more reasonable include: lower healing by 75%, increasing cost to 3 elixir, and cutting HP by half. 
            </p>
            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Heal Spirit has multiple issues that just prevent it from being a true force in the metagame. First of all, its healing is 
                rather abysmal, and it is only good when healing mulitple units. Another troubling problem with the card is how you only get
                one heal spirit. Compare this card to the fire spirits, which give three spirits for the price of 2 elixir, or 2/3 elixir 
                per spirit. Finally, heal spirit's one good combo - it and royal hogs - gets obliterated by log + bomb tower or rocket for an
                even trade. While the latter combo is unavoidable, the former one seems rather unfair. So to remedy this situation, I present
                some ways to buff the heal spirit: increasing number of spirits to 2, increasing healing power by 50%, and making sure that heal
                spirit does not die to log.
