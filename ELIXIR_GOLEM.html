            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Elixir Golem, by design, is simply too overpowered. Playing against is nearly impossible unless 
                you have the right counters to the card. For starters, giving elixir to the opponent when destroyed 
                is meaningless when their tower is destroyed in the process. The low cost of the card enables it to 
                be played as a beatdown deck while preventing effective opposite lane punishment (due to the user still 
                having seven elixir left to defend). The swarmy nature of the smaller forms of the Elixir Golem makes the 
                card harder to deal with. It can be paired with Miner for tanking purposes, similar to the Lava 
                Hound + Miner combo. The DPS of Elixir Golem is also alarming, being greater than even the Golem's. Decks 
                involving the card are simple to use, often involving spamming units behind the Elixir Golem (like Battle 
                Healer, Night Witch, Electro Dragon, etc.) and dropping Rage to boost everything. There is no skill involved 
                in this type of gameplay. Furthermore, playing against the card mandates absolute precision and one minor mistake 
                can cost you the game (believe me, I know). In the end, this card needs a rework to make it less oppressive. While 
                balance changes have focused on HP reduction, the more important area to focus on is elixir regeneration. To make 
                the card more high skill and less spammy, the following changes should be made: increase cost to four elixir, decrease 
                DPS of all forms by 3%, and alter elixir regeneration so that one elixir each is given for the defeat of the main Elixir 
                Golem and each of the two Elixir Golemites. No elixir is given for the defeat of the Elixir Blobs. The overall "cost" 
                is still seven, but since the opponent gets elixir faster, defeating it is no longer absurdly difficult. These changes 
                should help the card receive less criticism and still have it be a viable card.
            </p>
            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Elixir Golem really needs buffs because it is outclassed by every other tank out there. Its sole unique mechanic is 
                annoying in that the elixir given to the opponent quickly turns into a massive counterpush. The card also has little HP 
                and gets defeated by nearly anything. Any splash unit can make quick work of the card's various forms. Additionally, 
                using Clone on the card is disastrous as it gives the opponent four free elixir. Any real power decks with this card have 
                is due to the support troops, not the Elixir Golem. As such, this card could use a little love. Changes include: an HP buff, 
                not letting the opponent get elixir from cloned Elixir Blobs, and the addition of death damage to each form. Hopefully, Elixir 
                Golem can shine after these changes are implemented.
