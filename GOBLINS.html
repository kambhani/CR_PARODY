            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Goblins is a very good card and in desparate need of nerfs. For one, its cheap cost enables cycling. In 
                fact, the card can inflict tower damage when placed at the bridge and the opponent ignore it. Also, their 
                high hitpoints enable the card to survive a zap or snowball, making the card very annoying to get rid of. Goblins 
                can deal an astonishing 270 DPS at tournament standard, making short work of troops like Bandit, Sparky, and Mini 
                Pekka (with the help of the princess tower). In nearly every way, Goblins are beefed-up skeletons, and seeing how that 
                card is seen as OP, it leaves little doubt as to the OP nature of the card at hand. To make Goblins less of a threat, 
                the number of goblins should be reduced to 2. Changing goblin count is the only way to rework Goblins without 
                affecting the other card which use it. The day the count is reduced to two is most definitely the day in which 
                Clash Royale rises back into glory.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Goblins suffer from below-average use rates in both ladder and grand challenges, and currently, the card is inferior 
                to Skeletons, Spear Goblins, and Goblin Gang, all of which have higher use rates. Skeletons, though inferior to 
                Goblins in nearly every aspect, are cheaper, and thus fit into more decks. Spear Goblins, though they have lower HP, 
                can attack air, making it a good card in Miner cycle decks. Finally, Goblin Gang offer significantly more value for 
                one more elixir. Goblins needs buffs to be useful, and the best one would be to have four goblins and not three. This 
                would make the card an actual alternative to the other cards I mentioned above. The meta would also benefit from having 
                Goblins in it.
