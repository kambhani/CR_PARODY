            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Dark Prince is too powerful and really needs a nerf. One of the biggest problems with the card is its splash 
                damage. In the normal state, most swarm cards are deemed ineffective because of it. In the charging state, 
                however, the card becomes a total nightmare. A charging Dark Prince deals splash damage all around itself when 
                it attacks. This prevents the opponenet from simply surrounding the card with swarms to take it out, as they 
                might do against a card like Wizard. Furthermore, the shield on the card makes getting spell value nearly 
                impossible. The health of the shield is quite high, able to survive even a Zap. Overall, Dark Prince needs some 
                nerfs. Key ones to dish out include the removal of 360 degree splash with the charge attack and an HP nerf to the 
                shield. These changes should keep the card at bay.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
               Dark Prince is such an underwhelming card. Any job it does can be done by other cards better. Tanking and splash, 
               for example, are much better handled by the Valkyrie. Actual DPS is better handled by the Prince. Cheap tankage is 
               better handled by the Knight. The list goes on and on — there is simply no reason to use this card. Though there are 
               a few decks that try to use it (Giant Double Prince, some Golem decks, and some 3M decks), in all honesty, these decks 
               would be better off replacing the Dark Prince for something else. After all, besides the inferior defensive aspects of 
               the card, there is also the lackluster offensive capabilities to address. Taking out the Dark Prince is so easy; in 
               fact, it is as simply as placing a Knight or Valkyrie on the field. For the more challenge inclined, the standard 
               tank + DPS troop combo also works — see Ice Golem + literally any ranged unit. In the end, the Dark Prince is on the 
               weaker side of cards and could use some buffs. Some needed buffs include a 3x multiplier on the charge attack and a DPS 
               buff by 5%. Hopefully, these changes should be enough to bring the card back into the game.
