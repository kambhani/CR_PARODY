        <h3 id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Classic Log Bait has been around for a while. The objective has always been simple — bait out the opponent's small 
            spells and punish them for using it. There are many variants of the original, and I will go over them in this 
            guide. Get ready!
        </p>
        <h3 id="cards"><strong>Cards</strong></h3>
        <h4><em>Ice Spirit</em></h4>
        <div style="width: 97px; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px;"><img src="CARD_IMAGES/ICE_SPIRIT.png"></div>
        <p>
            Ice Spirit is an important card in this deck, though not as important as others. The card serves many 
            purposes. One such purpose is cycling. Against faster cycle decks (like Miner Bats WB cycle, 2.6, 2.9, 
            etc.), using this card is crucial to avoid being outcycled. Ice Spirit also serves as a good utility card, 
            being able to deny damage from a multitude of cards. For example, it can stop all damage from a Mega Minion 
            and Royal Recruit (spawned from a Royal Delivery). With precise timing, it can mitigate all skeleton damage 
            from a Skeleton Barrel (but not the death damage). Ice Spirit also has a great synergy with Goblin Barrel. 
            Placing the Ice Spirit at the bridge just after a Goblin Barrel will result in the Ice Spirit tanking for the 
            Goblins from the Goblin Barrel. Left ignored, this combo can dish out over 1000 damage. This card can be used 
            for chip damage if desired. Replacing this card is not recommended, but if desired, some alternatives include 
            Heal Spirit, Skeletons, Skeleton Army, Dart Goblin, Skeleton Barrel, or a small spell. Of these options, the 
            first two are great for cycling, the next three are great for spell bait, and the final one is good for general utility.
        </p>
        <h4><em>The Log</em></h4>
        <div style="width: 97px; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px;"><img src="CARD_IMAGES/THE_LOG.png"></div>
        <p>
            The Log is a crucial card to this deck. The most important thing this card provides is damage (obviously). The card 
            counters many other cards like Goblin Gang, Princess, Dart Goblin, and more. The cheap cost also enables using the 
            card for cycling. Like Ice Spirit, using the card frequently is imperative against fast cycle decks. The Log is also 
            good for simply getting chip, dealing 84 damage at tournament standard. The one drawback of this card is its inability 
            to attack aerial troops, but since that role is covered by other cards in this deck, that is fine. Replacing The Log is 
            highly discouraged since it plays a vital role in the deck. The only reason to try substituting this card is if upgrading 
            a Legendary card proves to be too difficult. Possible replacements, in this case, include Zap, Giant Snowball, and Arrows. 
            These cards, being of Common rarity, are far easier to upgrade. The final one, in particular, can one-shot Minions, a 
            useful property to have in mid-ladder.
        </p>
        <h4><em>Goblin Barrel</em></h4>
        <div style="width: 97px; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px;"><img src="CARD_IMAGES/GOBLIN_BARREL.png"></div>
        <p>
            Goblin Barrel is one of the core cards in this deck, being the primary win condition in most matchups. Its role is quite 
            obvious — after baiting out a spell, play the card on the tower for some easy chip damage. Different placements of the 
            card are necessary to maximize its potential. For example, against a deck with Royal Delivery, place the card in front of 
            the opposing Princess Tower (this gives the opponent less time to react). Alternatively, against a deck with The Log, 
            intentionally aiming the card <i>behind</i> the Princess Tower can trick the opponent into missing their spell. In a 
            pinch, the card can used on defense. Replacing this card is not advised. The only possible substitution would be Skeleton 
            Barrel, but the two cards work differently. Upgrading this card quickly is also crucial since a Zap or Giant Snowball one 
            level higher than this card will one-shot it. This interaction change makes matchs much harder.
        </p>
        <h4><em>Goblin Gang</em></h4>
        <div style="width: 97px; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px;"><img src="CARD_IMAGES/GOBLIN_GANG.png"></div>
        <p>
            An important card to this deck, Goblin Gang serves as a useful swarm to bait out The Log or another small spell. Proper 
            placement will let the card deal with many other cards, including Knight, Musketeer, Wizard, and Valkyrie. The latter two, 
            in particular, are prevalant in mid-ladder, making this card even more valuable. The card also works well with Knight. 
            Simply placing this card behind it forces the opponent to quickly respond. If they use their small spell by mistake, 
            sending in a Goblin Barrel afterwards ensures easy chip damage. Being a Common, Goblin Gang is relatively easy to upgrade. 
            As with other cards, replacing this one is not recommended. The only reasonable replacement would be Skeleton Army, but 
            this card has the disadvantage of being countered by most spells. Skeleton Army is also an Epic, so upgrading it for use on 
            ladder is harder.
        </p>
        <h4><em>Knight</em></h4>
        <div style="width: 97px; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px;"><img src="CARD_IMAGES/KNIGHT.png"></div>
        <p>
            Knight is a useful card in this deck. It serves the purpose of an all-round utility card. It can deal with many threats 
            like Valkyrie, Wizard, Musketeer, and Mini Pekka. In fact, with proper placement and timing, Knight can counter a solo
            Mega Knight (with help from the Princess Tower). Being a Common, this card is also easy to upgrade. The card synergizes 
            well with Goblin Gang and Goblin Barrel, acting as a tank for both cards. Unlike most other cards in this deck, there is 
            a viable replacement for this card, namely Valkyrie. At the cost of one more elixir, Valkyrie offer more HP, DPS, and even 
            splash damage. The final property makes dealing with Graveyard a lot easier.
        </p>
        <h4><em>Princess</em></h4>
        <div style="width: 97px; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px;"><img src="CARD_IMAGES/PRINCESS.png"></div>
        <p>
            Princess is another staple of this deck. She is able to get value because the opponenet cannot spell her away without 
            getting punished. As such, they will try to use troops to take her out. That being the case, it is imperative to protect 
            the Princesses. They can get a lot of value if left ignored. She is excellent on defense due to her large splash radius. 
            On offense, her immense range allows her to chip towers without getting targetted. This property lets her be a win 
            condition in matchups where the Goblin Barrel is not connecting. For example, against 2.6 and 2.9, Princess chip is an 
            important part of winning since a competent player will never let the Goblin Barrel connect. Replacing her is impossible; 
            she is vital to the success of this deck. The good thing to note, however, is that she is pretty level independent, so a 
            low level Princess will not hurt too much on ladder.
        </p>
        <h4><em>Inferno Tower</em></h4>
        <div style="width: 97px; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px;"><img src="CARD_IMAGES/INFERNO_TOWER.png"></div>
        <p>
            Inferno Tower is a useful addition to this deck, performing the quintessential role of tank-killer. This card makes 
            many matchups so much easier. For example, this card (as well as Rocket) makes the Goblin Giant-Sparky matchup a 
            breeze. Lava Hound matchups are also quite easy thanks to this card. Against mid-ladder decks, Inferno Tower counters 
            both Mega Knight and Royal Giant. Against Golem matchups, their push is severely limited because they have to use 
            Lightning on the Inferno Tower. In other matchups, however, the card is less useful. For example, in the mirror 
            matchup, this card will seldom be used. Replacements for this card include Tesla and Tornado. The former card, while 
            not being as effective of a tank-killer, is cheaper. The latter card, while not very helpful with killing tanks, can 
            be useful in securing King Tower activations. Tornado can also be combined with Rocket for massive damage to troops.
        </p>
        <h4><em>Rocket</em></h4>
