            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Fire Spirits just feel way too strong, to the point of needing serious nerfs. For starters, 
                the cheap cost enables cycling, and when played at the bridge, the card can get nearly 
                400 damage on the tower when ignored. The splash damage that each spirit creates upon death 
                can be used to devastating effect, most notably in destroying Minion Horder for a +3 
                interaction. The cards works very well with cards like Royal Giant and Hog Rider as they 
                eliminate any swarms played, making way for either aforementioned card to inflict severe 
                damage to the crown towers. The easiest way to make the card more fair is to spawn two spirits 
                instead of three. This will NOT affect Furnace, which is a good thing. The card will also kill 
                Minions, preserving a key interaction. Another potential nerf would be to lower area damage, but 
                this will come with the unfortunate side effect of affecting Furnace.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Fire Spirits is one of the most underused cards in the game and for good reason: in their current 
                form, they are far too weak. It's not that the concept is bad, but rather that other cards can do 
                the job better. Princess, for example, can do the same things that Fire Spirits can (and way more), 
                for simply one more elixir. Fire Cracker is another viable alternative to the card. One good buff to 
                the card would be to increase the count to four, as this would make the card more valuable. The buff 
                would also NOT affect furnace. Another good buff would be to increase the damage of each spirit (at 
                tournament standard) to 190 as this would allow each spirit to kill an equivalent level minion, 
                creating a new interaction in favor of the card. This change, however, will affect Furnace. Regardless, 
                it is my firm belief that when these changes are implemented, the card will be viable once again.
