            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Earthquake is extremely overpowered for its measly cost of three elixir. For starters, the damage it 
                does to buildings cripples their use on defense. A great example of this would be split Royal Hogs + 
                Earthquake. Normally, the best way to counter this is to use a building, bring the hogs to the middle, 
                and take out the distracted hogs with support troops. However, the Earthquake makes this impossible. 
                The presence of the card in a deck also cripples X-Bow decks as their main win condition is a building. 
                Another annoying aspect of the card is its damage as it is able to one-tick skeletons and take out Goblins 
                in three ticks. This makes defending a Hog + Earthquake push with Skeleton Army or Goblin Gang a surefire way 
                to lose the match. Additionally, the card does not do reduced tower damage, meaning that the card does more 
                damage to the crown tower than a Fireball. This is simply unfair, and makes Earthquake cycling a reliable way 
                to take off the last 500 to 600 damage on a tower. Finally, the slowdown effect (similar, but less potent than 
                the Ram Rider's snare), makes defending pushes with the card that much harder. Overall, the card needs drastic 
                nerfs to make it more fair. The best nerfs to give this card would be a crown tower damage reduction, a movement 
                slowdown reduction, and an overall damage reduction.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Earthquake is suffering from low use rates because of multiple inherent issues with the card. The main such one is 
                that the card does not even do enough damage to kill a Princess or Dart Goblin. This makes users of the card suffer 
                tremendously against Log Bait decks. Considering the prevalance of the bait archetype in general, Earthquake's 
                pathetic damage needs fixing. Additionally, the card is rather weak in actually destroying buildings. A Hog + 
                Earthquake push cannot even get past an Inferno Tower. These issues hold the card back, and they need to be 
                addressed before the card is viable. The issues should be addressed by: increasing building damage to 3.5x normal 
                damage, increase normal damage to 220, and (if really needed) increase the radius to four tiles.
