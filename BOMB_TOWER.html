            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Bomb Tower is one of the most powerful buildings in the game, and for just four elixir, it seems a little too 
                powerful. It hard counters win conditions like Royal Hogs and Elixir Golem, and its splash damage allows the 
                card to decimate bait decks. Despite only being able to target ground troops, the card can actually counter 
                air cards like the Balloon because its HP allows the Princess Towers to finish the aerial cards off. Bomb Tower 
                can be found in decks ranging from Splashyard to Miner control. Overall, this card needs a nerf. Some nerfs which 
                could make the card less powerful include an HP nerf, a damage nerf, or both. Bomb Tower is a toxic card that has 
                no need to be as prevalant as it is.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
               Bomb Tower is one of the weaker buildings in the game. Its short lifetime of 25 seconds means that the card gets little 
               value. Decks that this card supposedly hard counters, like Royal Hog decks, can bypass this issue by carrying Earthquake. 
               It can only attack ground troops, making the card virtually useless against Lava Hound decks. The death damage that this 
               card provides is small. Additionally, most troops walk out of the death bomb radius by the time it explodes. Finally, the 
               DPS of this card is rather absymal. In sum, Bomb Tower needs a buff. Some possible buffs include: a lifetime increase, a 
               DPS buff, or both. Bringing this card back into the metagame will be a good thing.
