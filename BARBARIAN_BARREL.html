            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Simply put, Barbarian Barrel's two-in-one functionality of spell and troop makes it far too 
                powerful. The spell portion can make short work of swarms like Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang, 
                Goblin Barrel, etc. The troop that spawns can be used as a tank (for cards like Graveyard 
                and Three Musketeers) and damage (cycle at bridge for tower chip damage). The inherent 
                flexibility of this card is seen in its very high use rates in Grand Challenges. To bring 
                this card in line with other spells, nerfs are needed. One such nerf could be to reduce the 
                travel distance of the spell so that the Barbarian will not reach the tower when the card is 
                cycled at the bridge. Another reasonable nerf would be to reduce the damage so the card does 
                not kill Goblins.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                While the Barbarian Barrel may seem good in theory, in reality it is outshined by The Log and 
                Zap, meaning that the card is not a viable contender. Its travel distance is much smaller than 
                The Log's and unlike Zap, this card does not attack aerial units or reset troops. The spawned 
                Barbarian also dies very quickly, meaning that the tanking properties it possesses are minimal. 
                Overall, this card desparately needs buff to put it back into the metagame. The best buff, in 
                my opinion, would be to increase its damage so it kills Archers and Firecrackers. This will give 
                the card a distinct advantage over The Log and Zap, meaning use rates will go up. If the 
                aforementioned change comes to no avail, a travel distance buff could also be employed.
