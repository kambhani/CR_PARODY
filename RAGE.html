            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Rage is too powerful for the two elixir cost it has. For one, its 5 tile radius is very large, 
                making it rage up troops in a large area. The upgrade pattern of increased duration makes the 
                card much more annoying to deal with when all cards are level 13. This upgrade pattern was 
                actually used with Freeze, until a balance patch changed that card to have a 4 second duration 
                at every level. The card amplifies properties of the cards in it, making it very annoying when 
                paired with specific cards. Examples include Elixir Golem push + Rage, Goblin Giant + Sparky + 
                Rage, and the infamous Elite Barbarians + Rage. To make the card less OP, especially when maxed, 
                the card should be changed so that the duration at every level is 7.5 seconds. To give players an 
                incentive to upgrade the card, it should only rage troops at an equivalent or lower level. This also 
                serves as a nerf to the card on ladder, preventing people from using a level 6 Rage on level 13 
                Elite Barbarians. Finally, the radius should be reduced to 4 tiles. These changes will make the card 
                more balanced, especially on ladder.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Rage is an underused card because it is situational, lacking the versatility that nearly every other spell 
                possesses. Despite its cheap cost, the card is not used for cycling because it is a waste of elixir whereas 
                other cycle cards like Ice Spirit and Heal Spirit get tower chip damage for a lower cost. The card's 
                defensive capabilites are also lacking, unlike other spells which usually excel at both defense and offense. 
                A meta with rage would honestly be interesting to see and to that end, the following changes should be 
                considered: adding damage to the card, similar to Freeze (so the card can be used for chip damage) and 
                increasing the boost to 50% for the user's crown towers (to allow for more defensive value). Rage makes the 
                game more fast-paced (and thereby more fun), and by implementing the above changes, we can do just that.
