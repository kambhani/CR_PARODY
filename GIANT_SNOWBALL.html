            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                For two elixir, Giant Snowball offers too much value. It attacks both ground and air, knocking back 
                troops while also slowing them down for a considerable length of time. The card deals enough damage to 
                kill Spear Goblins, Bats, and Skeletons. Overall, you can't go wrong with this two elixir card. It also 
                has an amazing synergy with Ram Rider, with the combo being on the verge of broken. Giant Snowball is one 
                of the most used cards in the game, owing to the facts mentioned above. To ensure a more diverse meta, a 
                remedy must be established, coming in the form of nerfs to the card. The best nerf to the card would be a 
                damage reduction so that it does not kill Spear Goblins. If that proves insufficient, then a slowdown 
                reduction could also work.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Giant Snowball is a decent card, but there are things that could be improved about it to bring back into all 
                arenas. Currently, it suffers from being too high-skill of a card. This is seen in the above average use rates 
                in grand challenges, but only an average use rate on ladder. Also, in both game modes, Zap is consistently 
                used more, showing how Giant Snowball is not as versatile. To better balance the use rates between the two cards,  
                Giant Snowball could use some buffs. The best one, in my opinion, would be to remove the travel time and simply 
                have the snowball fall from the sky, similar to Zap. A greater slowdown duration could also be explored (3 seconds 
                should be ideal). If these changes were to be implemented in the game, the skill required would go down and the card 
                would be used more.
