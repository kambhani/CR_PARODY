            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                For three elixir, Knight is one of the most versatile cards in the game. It needs nerfs to make it more fair. 
                One main problem with the card is its insame HP. With over 1400 HP, the card can even survive a Rocket. It can, 
                with the help of the crown tower, take out a Mega Knight, Valkyrie, and more. The DPS of the card is decent, being 
                able to one-shot cards with HP up to Goblins. Not even Zap can one-shot Goblins. The range of Melee: Medium is also 
                slightly overpowered when considered with the rest of his stats. The Knight's versatility is evident in his status as 
                one of the most-used cards in the game. From Ice Bow to Log Bait to Miner cycle to Graveyard, there are just so many 
                decks that use the card. While some card versatility is good, the Knight simply has too much of it. To remedy the issue, 
                some stats need to be reduced. This would make the card less versatile and make it more fair. Among the plethora of ways 
                to do this include an HP nerf, a range nerf, a DPS nerf, or any combination of the above three.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Knight is decent at everything, but that is simply another way of saying good at nothing. There is no specific area in 
                which Knight is a hard counter. Rather, it is okay at dealing with many threats. This is a problems as more fine-tuned 
                decks will choose other cards over the Knight, simply because they don't need the Knight's mediocrity. For example, a 
                deck with abundant tankage will likely choose Mini Pekka over Knight because the former is better at tank killing. 
                Similarily, other decks may choose Valkyrie over Knight because of her greater DPS and splash damage. Still other decks 
                may choose Ice Golem over Knight because of its cheaper cost. Since there is no specific role the Knight fits, stats need 
                to be boosted so that it does. Ways to do this include an HP increase (making it a viable tank) or a DPS increase (making it 
                a viable tank killer).
