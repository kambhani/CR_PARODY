            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                 Mirror is in many ways one of the most broken cards I have come across. With it, bait decks simply cannot work, destroying
                 an entire archetype. After all, even if you can successfully bait out a log or fireball, they will have another one in store.
                 Mirror is especially broken with goblin barrel as it gives a level boost to the goblins, forcing the tower to need three shots
                 to kill each goblin. Left unchecked, a mirrored goblin barrel can dish out over 1000 damage at tournament standard. Mirror is 
                 also especially annoying when used immediately after a previous card play. Think, for example, of two princesses at the bridge,
                 sniping away at the opposing tower. A mirrored sparky will NOT die to a normal rocket, further upsetting the fine interaction
                 balances that Clash Royale has come to depend so heavily on. I am in strong favor of a drastic nerf to the card. Possible ideas
                 include making mirror cost +3 or decreasing the card level when it is mirrored. I hope I have your support for this idea.

            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                 Mirror has consistently been one of the most underused cards in the game. Despite its potential, it does receive much use in grand
                 challenges or ladder, likely because it is very rare for someone to need the exact same card twice in a row. Even if that were the 
                 case, it is unlikely that someone would be willing to spend +1 elixir for the card. In its current state, there are only a few niches
                 where mirror can viably fit, most notably in bait decks. I propose a strong buff to mirror to make it more viable in the current metagame.
                 For example, mirror can be made at a neutral cost, rather than +1. This will help mirror be a stronger card. Making mirror -1 or -2 is 
                 also an option if mirror needs more help.
