            <h3>WHY IT IS OVERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Consistently one of the most used cards in the game, Skeletons provide far too much value for 
                one elixir. With the help of the crown tower, they can take out cards like Mega Minion, Mini 
                Pekka, and Ice Wizard for insane positive elixir trades. Left alone, this card can dish out 
                over 200 DPS at tournament standard which is far too much. They are also good for cycling. Their 
                immense utility explains why they fit in a variety of decks, including 2.6 Hog cycle, 2.9 X-Bow 
                cycle, 3.5 Ice Bow, and 2.8 Log Bait. Clearly, this card is in need of a nerf. Some ways to balance
                this card (while not harming other skeleton-based cards) include reducing the number of skeletons to
                2 and making the skeletons spawn in a line (this will prevent skeletons from surrounding troops). These 
                changes will make the card less toxic.
            </p>
            <h3>WHY IT IS UNDERPOWERED</h3>
            <p>
                Skeletons are quite overrated, despite their high use rates. They die to anything and cannot be used as solo 
                tower chip damage. Furthermore, you can get much more value by using Skeleton Army, which give a skeleton for 
                0.2 elixir, compared to the 0.33 elixir per skeleton in Skeletons. This is unfair. Skeletons is also a high-skill 
                card, meaning that lower-level players cannot use it as effectively. To remedy this abhorrent situation, the card 
                must be given meaningful buffs. One such buff would be to spawn four skeletons in a square formation. This allows 
                the card to better surround solo troops coming to the tower. It also decreases the cost per skeleton to 0.25 
                elixir which is much more reasonable. Overall, skeletons are almost at the point of being good. They just need 
                a little more love, and I hope that they receive it.
